Scorpiano is a system for automatic music transcription (AMT) for monophonic piano music, based on digital signal processing techniques.
The system is realised as a python program with simple graphical interface created using GTK3 and allows sheet music generation from input monophonic piano recording.
The sheet music can be exported as image in PNG format, MusicXML or MIDI files.
The goal of this project is to show that some problems can be tackled down with great success without using machine learning approaches.
The system was presented on [ETAI](https://etai.org.mk/en/home/) 2021 conference.
The paper can be found on [this](https://github.com/BojanSof/scorpiano/blob/main/paper/ANT.pdf) link.
