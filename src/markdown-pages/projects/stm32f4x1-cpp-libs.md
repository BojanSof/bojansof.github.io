STM32F4 BlackPill C++ libraries is a project providing modern C++ interfaces for peripheral devices of STM32F401CC and STM32F411CE MCUs, found on so-called STM32 BlackPill boards, and external devices, such as OLED and TFT-LCD displays, resistive touch, serial EEPROMs and shift registers.

The purpose of the project is to learn how to use modern C++ constructs for embeddded software development, in combination with CMake for project management.
The C++17 standard is used and many examples for how to use the interfaces are provided.
Two additional projects are developed with intention to be used alongside this project: [EmbeddedGfx](https://github.com/nikodinovska/EmbeddedGfx), graphics library for embedded targets, and [FSM-Generator](https://github.com/BojanSof/FSM-Generator), compile-time FSM generator written using the C++17 standard.
