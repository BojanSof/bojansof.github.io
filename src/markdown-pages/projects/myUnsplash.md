### Overview

My Unsplash is a fully featured image gallery - a clone of Unsplash. It is built with React, Redux Toolkit, Firebase Storage, and TailwindCSS. It is a fully responsive, mobile-first, and accessible website. Created with masonry layout, dark mode, optimized images, lazy loading, and a custom search.

The project was a solution to <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>My Unsplash challenge.</span></a>
### The challenge

Create my Unsplash app. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Create your API. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below::
<ul>
<li>-I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added</li>
<li>-I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
</li>
<li>-I can search for photos by label</li>
<li>-When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button</li>
<li>-I can delete images</li>
</ul>
