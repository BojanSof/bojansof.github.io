### Overview

The project was a challenge from [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).
I decided that my portfolio of projects is lacking something good-looking and well designed so coding that landing page would be a good experience and asset. 

### The challenge

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS. Utility and Mobile First CSS was a challenge itself. Nevertheless, the experience was really good and allowed me to create this project in a little more than 24 hours.
