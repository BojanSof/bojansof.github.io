This project is collection of cellular automata simulations.
A [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) is a collection of cells arranged in a grid of specific shape, such that each cell changes state as a function of time, according to a defined set of rules driven by the states of neighboring cells.
The interface for cellular automaton allows implementing other cellular automata easily.
The project is developed in C++ using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and simple makefile for building.
