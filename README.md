# 💻 Terminal Portfolio

Terminal Portfolio is as the name suggests a terminal themed portfolio showcasing a bit about myself and my projects.

## 🗺️ Project outline

### 🆗 MVP project should feature:
- [ ] My name
- [ ] A catchy writer effect below, with something like "Developer... student... creator..." etc. 
- [ ] My photo from ASCII text
- [ ] About me
- [ ] Terminal styled boxes with projects
- [ ] List of projects

### 🕹️ More to consider and add
- [ ] Maybe command line styled input that when you write ls or dir shows list of projects, when you type in cd "project name" it opens a terminal styled project window
- [ ] Responsiveness (how to display photo with ASCII text to look good on smaller screens?)
- [ ] Blog
- [ ] CMS

## 🛠️ Work in progress

- [ ] Add styling
