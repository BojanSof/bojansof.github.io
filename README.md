## 🗺️ Project outline

### 🆗 MVP project should feature

- [x] ~~My name~~
- [x] ~~A catchy writer effect below, with something like "Developer... student... creator..." etc.~~
- [x] ~~My photo from ASCII text~~
- [x] ~~About me~~
- [x] ~~Terminal styled boxes with projects~~
- [x] ~~List of projects~~

### 🕹️ Ideas to consider

- [x] ~~Responsiveness (how to display photo with ASCII text to look good on smaller screens?)~~
- [ ] Maybe command line styled input that when you write ls or dir shows list of projects, when you type in cd "project name" it opens a terminal styled project window
- [ ] Blog
- [ ] CMS
- [ ] Acryllic effect
- [ ] Semi transparent background for terminal 
- [ ] Mac looks
